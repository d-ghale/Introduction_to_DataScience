# Capstone project IDS (MA)

**Instructions**

This project is supposed to simulate the Data Science Cascade (answering questions by
using data and code), thereby yielding insights and elucidating meaning.

**Specific steps:**

1) Form a small team of 2-5 people (this can in principle also be a one-person solo team, if you
strongly prefer that, but that will be a lot of work, as this is designed as a team project) and give
your team a name.

2) Find a dataset in a subject area that you’re interested in. The richer (lots of rows and columns),
the better.

3) Ask questions of this data and answer them using the topics we covered in this class. The general
workflow should be that you ask a question, then write code that – together with the data –
yields a numerical result (and ideally a figure). You then need to interpret the figure and the
numerical result to provide a qualitative answer to the question you started with.

4) The deliverable (to be uploaded to the Brightspace portal) is a zip file that consists of 3 parts: The
file with the project report (PDF, please), the data file (if the data is too large to upload, please
provide a link to an online repository in the report) and the code file. The zip file should be
named "dsga1001_capstoneProject_groupname.zip"

5) The report should be 5 pages (4-6, if you must), with the following structure:

a. Page 1: Introduction page. Should have a header that lists the group name, then all full
names of all team members along with their netID. After the header, please describe the
dataset in detail (what do the rows represent, what do the columns represent, where did
you get it from) and your overarching interest in this dataset.

b. Page 2: Question 1. Open this page with a qualitative (narrative, but specific) question.
Then, explain how you are – in principle – answering the question (e.g. “we’re comparing
the means of these columns, implementing a hypothesis testing approach”). After that,
state the numerical results and include a figure that illustrates the result. Note that no
code is necessary here. Put the code in the code file (which ideally consists of 3 sections
that ideally correspond to the analysis code for pages 2-4). End this page with a
qualitative (narrative) answer that interprets the quantitative results you obtained. To
answer your question, you can use either hypothesis testing, regression or machine
learning methods (pick one approach per question).

c. Page 3: Question 2. Like b), but this must be a different question. Again, you can use
either hypothesis testing, regression or machine learning methods. So both b) and c) can
use the same general type of method, or you can mix and match (e.g. hypothesis testing
in b), regression in c), much like we did for the Data analysis projects)

d. Page 4: Question 3. Same structure as in c), but again a new question. And again, you can
use the same overall method (Hypothesis testing, Regression, ML) that you already used
in b) and c), or a different one.

e. Page 5: Overall summary and conclusions. Make sure to touch on the following: What did
you learn about the data, all in all (integrating the results from the 3 answers to the 3
questions)? What overarching conclusions can you draw? What assumptions did you
make? What limitations does your analysis have? How could the questions be answered
better, if better data were available? Anything else you noticed or realized while doing
this project?
